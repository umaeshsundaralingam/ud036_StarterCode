# Project - Movie Trailer Website
The Movie Trailer Website is a site created for the Udacity "Full Stack Developer" Nanodegree program. As this is the first project of the program, the task was very simple; to create a site that displays poster images for various movies and when an image is clicked, a trailer for that movie plays.
# Getting Started
In order to get the site running, on a developmental standpoint:
- Download Python
- When running Idle, open -> entertainment_center.py
- In the top menu bar, select Run - > Module
- The browser will now open, loading the page.
