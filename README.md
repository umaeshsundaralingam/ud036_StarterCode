# Project - Movie Trailer Website
The Movie Trailer Website is a site created for the Udacity "Full Stack Developer" Nanodegree program. As this is the first project of the program, the task was very simple; to create a site that displays poster images for various movies and when an image is clicked, a trailer for that movie plays.
